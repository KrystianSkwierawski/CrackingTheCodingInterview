## Question
Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the
beginning of the loop.<br>
DEFINITION<br>
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so
as to make a loop in the linked list.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]<br>
Output: C 

## My Solution
Time complexity: O(n). <br>
Space complexity: O(n)
