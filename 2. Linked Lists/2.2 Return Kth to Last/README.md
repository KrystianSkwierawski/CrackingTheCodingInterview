## Question
Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

## My Solution
I used here the "Runner" technique described in the beginning of the chapter which is moving at 2x speed to get the length of the LinkedList.

Time complexity: O(n).<br>
Space complexity: O(1).
