## Question
Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
that node.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
lnput:the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f<br>
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a ->b->d->e->f

## My Solution
Time complexity: O(1).<br>
Space complexity: O(1).
