The hardest question for me in this chapter was the <a href="https://github.com/KrystianSkwierawski/CrackingTheCodingInterview/tree/main/1.%20Arrays%20and%20Strings/1.7%20Rotate%20Matrix">1.7 Rotate Matrix</a>, but the next question with the matrix <a href="https://github.com/KrystianSkwierawski/CrackingTheCodingInterview/tree/main/1.%20Arrays%20and%20Strings/1.8%20Zero%20Matrix">1.8 Zero Matrix</a> I solved quite easily.
