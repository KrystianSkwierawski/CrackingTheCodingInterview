## Question
Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures? 

## My Solution
I didn't use additional data structures and the algorithm is comparing every character of the string to every other character of the string.<br>
Time complexity: O(nÂ²). <br>
Space complexity: O(1). <br>

If additional data structures would be allowed I would use a Hashmap.
Time complexity: O(n). <br>
Space complexity: O(n) where n is length of the string.
