## Question
URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13<br>
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

## My Solution
Time complexity: O(1). <br>
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string. I returned a new string, but it is possbible to replace input and would take O(1).
