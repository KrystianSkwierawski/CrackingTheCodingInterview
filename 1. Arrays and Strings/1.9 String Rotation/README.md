## Question
String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").

## My Solution
Time complexity: O(1).
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string.
Auxiliary space complexity: O(1).
