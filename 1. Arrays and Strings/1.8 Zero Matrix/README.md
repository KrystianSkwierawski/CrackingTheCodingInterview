## Question
Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to 0.

## My Solution
Time complexity: O(nÂ² * m) when n is number of rows and m is number of columns or just O(n * m).<br>
Space complexity: O(m * n) I created a clone of the matrix.
