# CrackingTheCodingInterview
My solutions to <a href="https://www.amazon.pl/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850">"Cracking The Coding Interview"</a> questions. I created all the algorithms using the <a href="https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html">TDD methodologist.</a> I was creating the algorithms on my own and then comparing them with the solutions from the book. I used a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-o-notation-simple-explanation-examples-pamela-lovett/">Big O notation</a> to determine the time and space complexity of algorithms for worst-case scenarios. Considering the pros and cons of space, time, and clean of the code. There may be solutions that are better in speed, but not in memory, and vice versa.

## Tools
 * C#
 * .NET 6.0
 * NUnit
 * Fluent Assertions
