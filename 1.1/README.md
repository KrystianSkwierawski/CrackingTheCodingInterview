## Question
Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures? 

## My Solution
I didn't use additional data structures and the algorithm is comparing every character of the string to every other character of the string. This will take 0(nÂ²) time and 0(1) space.
